    <p>Two hours. One hundred and twenty minutes. Anything might be
    done in that time. Anything. Nothing. Oh, he had had hundreds
    of hours, and what had he done with them? Wasted them, spilt
    the precious minutes as though his reservoir were
    inexhaustible. Denis groaned in the spirit, condemned himself
    utterly with all his works. What right had he to sit in the
    sunshine, to occupy corner seats in third-class carriages, to
    be alive? None, none, none.</p>
