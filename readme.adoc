= Imprimatur
:toc:
:toclevels: 1


Imprimatur is a tool for performing automated functional testing on web
applications. The tests are described in a simple test script. Along with the
standard HTTP methods, Imprimatur handles authentication, file uploads and
HTTPS. The responses are validated using regular expressions.
 
Imprimatur runs on Python 2.7 and 3.5 on both CPython and PyPy.


== Licence

Imprimatur is released under the
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html[GPL].


== Installation

It's a good idea to set up a virtualenv:

 virtualenv venv
 . venv/bin/activate

then install Imprimatur with pip:

 pip install imprimatur


== Quickstart

To run an example test script save the following as a file called `test.py`:

 [
   {
     'host': 'www.google.com',
     'status_code': 200}] 

then run it with:

 imprimatur test.py

and it should come back saying all tests are passed. Here's another script with
some more examples:

 [
     {
         'name': "Single regex",
         'port': 5000,
         'host': "localhost",
         'path': "/text_2",
         'status_code': 200,
         'regexes': ['inexhaustible']},
     {
         'name': "Basic auth",
         'path': "/auth",
         'auth': ("conrad", "kurtz"),
         'status_code': 200},
     {
         'name': "File upload",
         'path': "/echo",
         'method': "post",
         'files': {"yellow": "tests/2/crome-file.txt"},
         'regexes': ["yellow", "on the leads"],
         'status_code': 200},
     {
         'name': "Post name and value with regex.",
         'path': "/echo",
         'method': "post",
         'data': {"quote": "Leisure is the mother of philosophy."},
         'status_code': 200,
         'regexes': ["Leisure"]},
     {
         'name': "Repeat until successful.",
         'path': "/counter",
         # 'max' is maximum number of times to try
         # 'period' is the number of seconds to wait between tries
         'tries': {'max': 3, 'period': 1},
         'status_code': 200,
         'regexes': ["The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire"]},
     {
         'name': "Regex on header.",
         'path': "/redirect?location=http://localhost:5000/here.html",
         'status_code': 302,
         'regexes': ["here.html"]},
     {
         'name': "HTTP HEAD request.",
         'path': "/text_1",
         'method': "head",
         'status_code': 200}]


== Reference

The full list of properties for each request is given below. A * after the
property name means that it is carried over to subsequent requests.

|===
| Name          | Notes

| scheme*
| Can be `'http'` (default) or `'https'`.

| host*
| Default is `'localhost'`.

| port*
| Default is `80`.

| auth*
| Sequence of username and password eg. `('conrad', 'kurtz')`

| verify*
| For an HTTPS request, verify the certificate. Can be `True` or `False`
  (default).

| name
| Used to label the request.

| path
| End of the URL eg. `'/retrieve?product_id=45'`. Default is `'/'`.

| method
| An HTTP method. eg. `'post'`. Default is `'get'`.

| data
| Dictionary of post values eg. `{'id': 45, 'name': 'agnez'}`

| files
| File name and path to upload. Eg. `{'yellow': 'crome.txt'}`

| tries
| Maximum number of times to try the URL. Eg. `{'max': 5, 'period': 2}`. The
  `max` value is the number of times to try, and the `period` is the number of
  seconds to wait between tries. If `max` is omitted it defaults to `10` and if
  `period` is omitted it defaults to `1`, so `{}` is equivalent to
  `{'max': 10, 'period': 1}`.

| regexes
| Sequence of https://docs.python.org/3.5/howto/regex.html[regular expressions]
  eg. `[r'go\s*ths', r'vandals']`

| status_code
| https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6[HTTP status code] to
  check for, eg. `200`

| headers
| Dictionary of HTTP headers eg. `{'Accept-Charset': 'utf-8'}`

| unzip
| If `True` then unzip the body of the response.

Cookies are always retained between requests.


== Web Interface

Imprimatur comes with a very basic web interface. You can try it out using
Imprimatur's built-in web server by doing:

 python -m imprimatur.web

Don't run it on a public facing production web server, as it is entirely
unsecure.

To run the regression tests, install http://testrun.org/tox/latest/[tox]:

 pip install tox


then run `tox` from the `imprimatur` directory:

 tox


== Building The Documentation

The docs are written using Asciidoctor. To build them, install asciidoctor:

 apt-get install asciidoctor

Then type:

 asciidoctor readme.adoc

and the doc will appear at `docs/index.html`.


== Doing A Release Of Imprimatur

Run `tox` make sure all tests pass, then update the release notes in
`readme.adoc` then do:
